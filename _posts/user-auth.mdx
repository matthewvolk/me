# Build your own user authentication REST API using Node and MongoDB

_Last Updated: June 20th 2020_

## Project Introduction

Chris Anderson from Microsoft once described Javascript as the &quot;English of Programming Languages&quot; - a lot of people can speak at least a little bit of it, even it it's bad. It's not a perfect language, but it's a language which is relatively easy to learn for a lot of people.

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build a simple REST API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## MongoDB

For this project, I'm going to be using a cloud-hosted, free version of MongoDB called [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). Go ahead and click the link, sign up for an account, and follow [this guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). You should end up with a connection string that looks similar to:

```shell
mongodb+srv://<dbusername>:<password>@dev-nycjj.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Copy that string to your clipboard and head into the next step.

## Folder Structure & Initial Routes

Open up your terminal and navigate to the directory you'd like to create your project folder in. Copy and paste the following line into your terminal

```shell
mkdir PROJECT_NAME && cd PROJECT_NAME && npm init
```

Walk through each step of the `npm init` script (our entry point is going to be `index.js`).

When you are done, create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory.

Open the `.env` file in your text editor and enter:

```
MONGODB_URI=URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_EARLIER
```

Save that file, and head back to your terminal. Run the following:

```shell
npm install express mongoose bcryptjs cors dotenv jsonwebtoken body-parser passport-jwt passport
```

Once installed, create an `index.js` file in the root directory of your project to serve as your main entry point file. You'll want to import all of the modules you need for this file, found below:

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const passport = require("passport");
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const cors = require("cors");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
mongoose.set("useUnifiedTopology", true);
```
